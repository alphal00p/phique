Heavy-Quark Pair Production in Two-Photon Fusion at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order in QCD with Coulomb Resummation

The code will calculate the total cross sections of heavy-quark pair production in two-photon collisions at high-energy colliders.

In addition to this repository, further documentation is available in
[arXiv:25XX.YYYYY](https://arxiv.org/abs/25XX.YYYYY). Please cite this
article, as well as relevant references therein, if you use `PHIQUE`.
