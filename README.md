Heavy-Quark Pair Production in Two-Photon Fusion at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order in QCD with Coulomb Resummation

The code will calculate the total cross sections of heavy-quark pair production in two-photon collisions at high-energy colliders.

In addition to this repository, further documentation is available in
[arXiv:25XX.YYYYY](https://arxiv.org/abs/25XX.YYYYY). Please cite this
article, as well as relevant references therein, if you use `PHIQUE`.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

Platform requirements

* `Linux` or `MacOS`.
* `bash`

Compiler requirements

* `gfortran` and `gcc`.

### Download and Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/alphal00p/phique.git
cd phique
./config
```

## Run

* Edit `input/run.inp`
* Run the code via
```
./RunPHIQUE
```

## Output

* Screen printout
* Files in the `output/` subdirectory (The output files are generated by `analysis/user/plot_NNLO.f90`. If you modify this file, you need to recompile the `PHIQUE` code for your changes to take effect.)

## Example

If you use the default `input/run.inp` and run the code, it will calculate the NNLO QCD and NLP Coulomb resummed cross section for top-quark pair production in ultraperipheral proton-proton collisions (with the ChFF photon flux from [gamma-UPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03012)) at 14 TeV. The total cross section is
